# Unhandled Exceptions in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository showcases a common error in Dart's asynchronous programming: insufficient handling of exceptions during network requests. The `bug.dart` file contains code that fetches data from an API but lacks robust error handling. The `bugSolution.dart` file provides an improved version with more comprehensive exception handling.

## Problem

The original code only prints a generic error message to the console.  In a real-world application, this is inadequate. Users need informative error messages, and the application should gracefully handle failures to avoid crashes or unexpected behavior.

## Solution

The improved code includes:

* More specific exception handling for different types of errors (e.g., network errors, JSON decoding errors).
* User-friendly error messages.
* Potential fallback mechanisms (e.g., displaying cached data if the network request fails).
